# Tour-and-Travel_Project
Creating a Responsive Tours and Travel Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Developed a fully responsive travel agency website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The home section has a responsive hero section with a video slider created using vanilla JavaScript. The website also includes a responsive book section, packages section, services section, gallery with hover effect section, review section with touch slider, contact section, brand section with touch slider, and a responsive footer section. Created a complete and responsive travel website design from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implemented advanced features like a video slider and touch slider for a seamless user experience. Used flexbox to make sections like book, packages, services, gallery, and review responsive. Improved my skills in front-end web development, particularly in creating responsive designs.
